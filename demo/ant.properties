# This file is used to override default values used by the Ant build system.
#
# This file must be checked into Version Control Systems, as it is
# integral to the build system of your project.

# This file is only used by the Ant script.

# You can use this to override default values such as
#  'source.dir' for the location of your java source folder and
#  'out.dir' for the location of your output folder.

# You can also use it define how the release builds are signed by declaring
# the following properties:
#  'key.store' for the location of your keystore and
#  'key.alias' for the name of the key to use.
# The password will be asked during the build when you use the 'release' target.

# You can use this if you want to override default paths
#  'sñreentester.attested.dir' for screenshots that have passed you visual test and
#  'screentester.result.dir' for output directory.

# write here folders with java sources and test sources
source.dir=src:testsrc

# Ant path to the screentester tools directory
tools.dir=../tools

#screentester.attested.dir=new_attested_screenshots
#screentester.result.dir=new_bin
